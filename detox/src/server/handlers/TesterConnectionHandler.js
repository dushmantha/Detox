1. Make sure your app is actually running on the device.
 If not - perhaps you forgot to write 'device.launchApp()'
 somewhere at the beginning of your test. There's also a
 chance that your app has crashed - use --record-logs CLI
 option to get the logs.

2. If your app IS running on the device, yet you see this message:
a) The native part of Detox failed to connect to the Detox server over
   web sockets.
   If this is the case, the logs from the app (e.g., --record-logs all)
   should be containing messages about those failed connection attempts.

b) The app is running without Detox native code injected.
   First, make sure you don't launch it manually â€” leave that to Detox.
   If you do need to launch your app manually, pay attention to:
     - (iOS) SIMCTL_CHILD_DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable
       It should point to the current Detox.framework path.
     - (Android) Correctness of the selected Android Instrumentation Runner
       and test class.

The following package could not be delivered:`,
